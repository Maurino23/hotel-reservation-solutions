## Project Overview
This project focuses on creating data-driven solutions for the hotel reservation industry. By analyzing reservation data, this project aims to improve profitability and customer satisfaction through advanced data science and machine learning techniques.

## Project Objectives
1. **Increase Profitability**: Understand customer segments, seasonal trends, and the effectiveness of reservation channels.
2. **Enhance Customer Satisfaction**: Identify key factors influencing booking success and customer preferences.

## Steps in the Project
This project includes the following major stages:

### 1. Define Questions & Goals
Key questions addressed include:
   - Seasonal trends in reservations
   - Customer types and lead times
   - Popular booking channels and market segments

### 2. Data Gathering
The dataset was sourced from [this link](https://bit.ly/DatasetChallengeDS) and includes details on reservations, customer types, and booking trends.

### 3. Data Assessment and Cleaning
Identified issues were:
   - Missing values in columns like `children`, `country`, and `company`
   - Data type inconsistencies in columns like `children`, `agent`, and `company`

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - **Lead Time Analysis**: Majority of bookings have a short lead time.
   - **Seasonal Trends**: High reservation rates observed in August.
   - **Customer Segments**: 'Transient' customers are the most frequent.

### 5. Feature Engineering
   - Created features for total guests, stay duration, and categorical encodings.

### 6. Machine Learning Model
   - Implemented a Random Forest model to predict reservation success.
   - Achieved an accuracy of 81.2% with an F1 score of 81.2%.

### 7. Evaluation and Recommendations
   - **Focus marketing efforts in August**.
   - **Strengthen partnerships with Travel Agents and Tour Operators**.
   - **Promote 'Bed & Breakfast' meal plans**.

## Results
The project results provide insights for strategic decisions:
   - Improved reservation success rates
   - Enhanced customer satisfaction through targeted offers
